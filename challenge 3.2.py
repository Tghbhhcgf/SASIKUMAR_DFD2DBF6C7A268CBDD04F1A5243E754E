#Implement a function called sort_students that takes a list of student objects as input and sorts the list based on their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string), and cgpa (float). Test the function with different input lists of students.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_number = roll_number
        self.cgpa = cgpa

def sort_students(student_list):
    # Sort the student list based on CGPA in descending order
    sorted_students = sorted(student_list, key=lambda student: student.cgpa, reverse=True)
    return sorted_students

# Example usage:
students = [
    Student("Alice", "101", 3.8),
    Student("Bob", "102", 3.6),
    Student("Charlie", "103", 4.0),
    Student("David", "104", 3.9),
]

sorted_students = sort_students(students)

# Print the sorted list of students
for student in sorted_students:
    print(f"Name: {student.name}, Roll Number: {student.roll_number}, CGPA: {student.cgpa}")
